This page now uses [zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

It was pretty straight forward to set up, simply following [getting-started](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/)
should get you up and running.


Deploying to GithubPages is also fairly simple [deployment](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/).


*Couple of things I had to look for:*

- **Formatting dates:** 

`{{ page.date | date(format=$chrono_format_string) }}` example: `{{ page.date | date(format="%D") }}`


- **Using the correct relative url in the template:**

`{ get_url(path=$path)}` example: `{ get_url(path="/")}`

- **Adding new lines in markdown:**

`<br/>`


---
**Update1:** \
Turns out that css matters in markdown spacing. The above `<br/>` trick is not needed if the css stylesheet used have a good enough spacing between paragraphs.\
Line breaks if needed can be added with `\`

Currently I have switched to [sakura css framework](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura).\
So far it looks quite nice and it adapts automatically to smaller screens.
